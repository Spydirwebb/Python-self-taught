a basic game vs a computer opponent with HP starting at 100 each. The opponent is stronger for strategy purposes.
You choose attack, block, save, or quit
The opponent choice is randomized: 70% attack 30% block
Attack can miss: 10%
Block can miss: 10%
Save writes health data to file
quit stops the program
